This is my final project for Promineo Tech's Backend Coding Program. We were tasked with implementing a JPA RESTful Web API with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations storing data in a MySQL database.
The project must meet the following requirements:
•  Database design which contains at least 3 entities and 3 tables 
•  Contains all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update & Delete)
•  Each entity should have at least one CRUD operation
    •  AND:  one or more entities needs to have all 4 CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update & Delete).
•  Contains at least one (1) one-to-many relationship
•  Contains at least one (1) many-to-many relationship with one or more CRUD operations on this relationship
•  Required:  REST Web API Server tested through Swagger, Postman or AdvancedRestClient (ARC) or a front-end client.
